# Deploying Next.js to cloud platforms

This repository provides an example of how you might deploy a Next.js application to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Firstly, lets install dependencies and run the Next.js development server.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
